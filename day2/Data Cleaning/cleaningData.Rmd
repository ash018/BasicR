### Cleaning data

In this part of the training, we will cover

* Tidy and untidy data
* Long and wide data
* Converting long to wide and vice versa
* Unite and separate columns
* String to time conversion
* Working with strings
* Working with missing data

```{r}
setwd("E:/Training_S/Cleaning Data in R")
data1 = read.csv("retail.csv", header = TRUE,  sep=";", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
head(data1)
```

#### Understand your data

```{r}
class(data1)
```

#### How many rows and columns in the dataset?

```{r}
dim(data1)
```

#### Column names?

```{r}
names(data1)
```

#### Understanding our data

```{r}
str(data1)
```

#### We can also use **dplyr** package

```{r}
library(dplyr)
glimpse(data1)
```

We can also use **summary()** function

```{r}
summary(data1)
```

### Tidy data

* Observations in rows
* Variables in columns
* Every table represents any one type of observational unit

### Untidy data

We have values as column names.

### Wide dataset vs long dataset

In wide dataset we have more columns than rows, in long dataset, we have more rows than columns

#### So among the 2 datasets that you have seen, which one is wide and which one is long?

### Using tidyr

**gather(data, key, value, ...)**

**data** is a dataframe
**key** is name of a new column
**value** is the name of a new value column
**...** is the names of the columns to gather

```{r}
#setwd("E:/Training_S/Cleaning Data in R")
data1 = read.csv("data1.csv")
data1
```

#### Gathering columns into key-value pairs or going from wide to long using **gather**

```{r}
library(tidyr)
data1_long = gather(data1, categories, values, -Name)
data1_long
```

We can also write this as **gather(data, aggregated_variable, value, columns_to_gather)**

### Spreading key-value pairs or going from long to wide using **spread()**

```{r}
data1_wide = spread(data1_long, categories, values)
data1_wide
```

**spread(data, key, value)**
data is the dataframe
Key is the name of column containiing keys
value is the name of the column containing values

### Separating columns

**separate(data, col, into)**
**data** is which dataframe to change
**col** is the name of the column to separate
**into** is the character vector of new column names

Let's have a look at a dataset where 2 persons have got 2 different type of treatments at 2 different times. The column **Time** has both year and month embedded in the column with **-** separating (or adding) the values of year and month.

```{r}
data2 = read.csv("data2.csv", colClasses=c("character","factor","numeric","character"))
data2
```

Now let's separate **Time** column into year and month

```{r}
data2_separated = separate(data2, Time, c("Year", "month"))
data2_separated
```

**separate** assumes that we want to separate a column based on some non-alphanumeric values like empty space, period, forward slash or adash. But if our separator is something else, we can mention it in a fourth parameter in **sep=""**.

### Unite columns

We use **unite()** function.

**unite(data, col, ...)**
data is the dataframe
col is the new united column name
... represent the column names to be united
By default, the sep is **_**
We can also specify the seperators as sep=""

```{r}
data2_united = unite(data2_separated, Time, Year, month)
data2_united
```

### Converting strings to date

We have a character of dates in the vector **date_string** which **R** doesn't recognize as date.

We can use **ymd()** function from lubridate package

```{r}
library(lubridate)
date_string = c("2010-01-27", "2010-12-21", "2012-09-29")
class(date_string)
date_date = ymd(date_string)
class(date_date)
date_date
```

**mdy()** function

```{r}
mdy("July 12, 2017")
```

**hms()** function

```{r}
hms("14:34:23")
```

#### Parsing date_time

```{r}
ymd_hms("2017/07/12 14.36.59")
```

#### Working with strings with stringr package

```{r}
library(stringr)
```

#### Trim whitespaces in a string

```{r}
str_trim("    hopefully, you are enjoying this training, are you???     ")
```

#### Pad string

```{r}
str_pad("678", width = 6, side="left", pad="0")
```

We can also check if a particular string is in a character vector

```{r}
popular_languages = c("R", "Python", "C", "Java")
r_in_popular_languages = str_detect(popular_languages, "R")
r_in_popular_languages
```

Suppose, C++ has replaced C in popularity and C has gone down by 5 or 6 positions. How do we update **popular_languages** vector? We use **str_replace(vector, old_value, new_value)**

```{r}
popular_languages = str_replace(popular_languages, "C", "C++")
popular_languages
```

### Missing values

This is normally represented as **NA** in excel.
If we import from Excel, the missing data will be **#N/A**
When we import from SAS/SPSS, the missing data will be .
In some cases, it can simply be empty string


Let's build a dataframe with some **NA** values

```{r}
data3 = data.frame(Type1 = c(23,34,NA,56,NA,55),
                   Type2 = c(22, 32,45,NA,76,90))
data3
```

#### Does this data have NA values?

```{r}
any(is.na(data3))
is.na(df)
```

#### How many NAs?

```{r}
sum(is.na(data3))
```

#### Indices of missing value

```{r}
which(is.na(data3$Type1))
```


We can also use **summary()** function to get idea about NAs.

#### Find rowws of missing data

```{r}
complete.cases(data3)
```
We can now subset our data to get only the rows with non-missing values

```{r}
data3[complete.cases(data3), ]
```

More comfortable though, is the use of **na.omit(dataframe)**

```{r}
na.omit(data3)
```

#### Is our data OK?

```{r}
set.seed(0)
data4 = c(rnorm(125, mean=20, sd=3),5, 40)

boxplot(data4)
```

We can check for errors that can come from variability in measurement, experimental error, data entry error, intentional error etc.

```{r}
set.seed(0)
data5 = data.frame(first=c(rnorm(24, mean=20, sd=3), 100),
                   second = rnorm(25, mean=30, sd=5),
                   third = rnorm(25, mean=40, sd=15))
summary(data5$first)
hist(data5$first, breaks=5)
```

We can also look at the box plot of all the columns

```{r}
boxplot(data5)
```
