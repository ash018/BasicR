```

## Data import

Flat files are simple files that display data in tables. csv files are flat files. </br>

![](1.png)

</br>
utils package in R contain the functionalities for importing csv files into r. We don't have to import utils package as it is loaded by default.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd("D:/Training_JU/Training/3_Importing Data in R")
```

```{r}
airStations = read.csv("airStations.csv", header = TRUE,  sep=";", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(airStations)
airStations
```

We can also use **read.csv2** function to read ; separated file

```{r}
airStations = read.csv2("airStations.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(airStations)
airStations
```


For **read.csv()**, by default, header=TRUE and sep=","

If the file is inside another directory data, then we can do following things
**path = file.path("~", "datasets", "states.csv")**
**read.csv(path, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)**

To have a look at all the files in the directory, use **dir()**


We also come across tab-delimited files. We read these with **read.delim()** function.

```{r}
values = read.delim("countryValues.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(values)
head(values, 3)
```

If the txt file didn't contain column names, we can specify them by using **col.names=c("Year", "Country", "Value")** inside **read.delim()** function.

For **read.delim()**, the default is **header = TRUE**, **sep = "\t"**

Now suppose the values are given with backslash '/' as the separator. We then need to use **read.table()** function.

![](2.png)

Here we have countryValues2.txt as '/' separated file. Let's import it.

```{r}
values2 = read.table("countryValues2.txt", header = TRUE,  sep="/", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(values2)
head(values2, 3)
```

We can also use read.table to read tab-delimited file by specifying **sep="\t"**

Select the year with highest and highest value

```{r}
highest = values2[which.max(values2$Value), ]
highest
```

### Task    

####Select the year with lowest and lowest value?

Now suppose we have the previous tab delimited dataset without any column name and with a new column indicating different states (poor, medium, good, very good) which is categorical in nature. How do we read this data?

Here, we can't just use stringsAsFactors argument to import both character and categorical columns.

```{r}
values3 <- read.delim("countryValues3.txt", header = FALSE, 
                       col.names = c("Year", "Country", "Value", "State"),
                       colClasses = c("numeric", "character", "numeric", "factor"))
str(values3)
head(values3, 3)
```

Please note that if a column is set to "NULL" in the **colClasses** vector, this column will not be loaded into the data frame.

### readr and data.table packages

First, load the package

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
```

Now, we will read the airstations.csv file with **read_csv()** function of **readr** package

```{r}
read_csv("airstations.csv")
```

####We use read_tsv for reading tab-separated file 
read_tsv(file_name, col_names=vector of column names)


###read.table() vs read.delim()

```{r}
values2 = read.table("countryValues2.txt", header = TRUE,  sep="/", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
values2
#In read_delim, we don't have to mention header and stringsAsFactors
values2_delim = read_delim("countryValues2.txt", delim="/")
values2_delim
```

If column name is absent, we need to say **col_names=FALSE** inside **read_delim()**

```{r}
values3_delim = read_delim("countryValues4.txt", delim="/",col_names=FALSE)
values3_delim
values3_delim2 = read_delim("countryValues4.txt", delim="/",
                            col_names=c("Year","Country","Value"))
values3_delim2
```

We can also specify column types using **col_types**

```{r}
read_delim("countryValues4.txt", delim="/",
                            col_names=c("Year","Country","Value"),
           col_types ="cci")
```

To skip a column, we can use **_** in **col_types**.

```{r}
read_delim("countryValues5.txt", delim="/",
                            col_names=c("Year","Country","Value"),
           col_types ="cci", skip = 3)
```


Use **nmax** to read a specified number of rows.

```{r}
read_delim("countryValues5.txt", delim="/",
                            col_names=c("Year","Value"),
           col_types ="c_i", skip = 3, n_max=4)
```

```{r}
time = col_date()
fac = col_factor(levels = c("Poor", "Medium", "Good", "Very Good"))
int = col_integer()
char = col_character()
data4=read_tsv("countryValues3.txt",
                            col_names=c("Year","Country","Value","State"),
           col_types ="ccic", skip = 0, n_max=5)
data4
summary(data4)
data4_2=read_tsv("countryValues3.txt",
                            col_names=c("Year","Country","Value","State"),
           col_types =list(char,char,int,fac), skip = 0, n_max=5)
data4_2
summary(data4_2)
```

###fread() in data.table() package

```{r}
library(data.table)
```

We can use fread() to read data both with header and without header in an easier way

```{r}
fread("airStations2.csv")
fread("airStations2_withoutHeader.csv")
```

We can also use other formats and **fread()** somehow guesses the separator and column types. We can also manually mention these inside **fread()**.

```{r}
fread("countryValues.txt")
```

We can also select particular columns to import or drop

```{r}
#Only select first and fourth column
fread("countryValues6.txt", select=c(1,4))
#We can also select by column names
fread("countryValues6.txt", select=c("Year","State"))
#Similarly, we can drop columns by index and column names
fread("countryValues6.txt", drop=c(2,3))
fread("countryValues6.txt", drop=c("Country","Value"))
```

###Reading Microsoft Excel files readxl package

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
```

####Name of the sheets in the excel file with excel_sheets()

```{r}
excel_sheets("airStations.xlsx")
```

####read_excel() is used to read excel file.

**read_excel(filename, sheet = sheetindex or sheetname)**. Note that, if we don't specify sheet here, then the first sheet will be read in.

```{r}
#without providing sheet argument
read_excel("airStations.xlsx")
#reading with sheet index
read_excel("airStations.xlsx", sheet=2)
#reading with sheet name
read_excel("airStations.xlsx", sheet="Economy")
```


###Reading all sheets with a single command

```{r}
#We will get the data of 3 sheets as three lists eacxh containing the respective dataset
all_sheets = lapply(excel_sheets("airStations.xlsx"), read_excel, path="airStations.xlsx")
all_sheets
```

Let's explore its documentation. Remember, how?

**col_names**, **col_types** and **skip** are some other useful arguments.

```{r}
#Note that blank in col_types skip the respective column
read_excel("airStations.xlsx", sheet=3, col_types = c("text","blank","numeric"), 
           skip = 1, col_names = c("country", "year", "sex-ratio"))
```

We can also specify the range of values that we want to import using **range** inside **read_excel()**.

```{r}
#read_excel(path="airStations2.xlsx", range="B1:F11")
```

We can also mention the highest number of rows to be read using **n_max**.

```{r}
#read_excel(path="airStations2.xlsx", n_max =10)
```

We can also mention the range of rows or range of columns separately using **cell_rows()** and **cell_col()** respectively.

```{r}
#Read only the rows from third upto sixth row
#read_excel(path="airStations2.xlsx", range = cell_rows(3:6))
```

Is this what we were expecting?? 

No, let's fix it.

```{r}
#read_excel(path="airStations2.xlsx", range = cell_rows(3:6), col_names=
#                                           c("X","Value","Station","lon","lat","alt"))
```


We can also mention the sheetname inside **range**.

```{r}
#read_excel("airStations.xlsx", range = "Economy!B1:C4")
```

We can also use **read.xls()** from gdata package. All the arguments of **read.table()** is available for **read.xls()** function. This package first converts an Excel file to a csv file using Perl. This is time consuming for a large excel file.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages("gdata")
library(gdata)
#read.xls("airStations2.xls", sheet="airStations")
```

###XLConnect package

This is useful if most of our files we work in are in Excel file. We can adapt our calculation sheet to R using this package.

```{r}
#install.packages("XLConnect")
#library(XLConnect)
```

We read sheets using **loadWorkbook()**.

```{r}
#excel = loadWorkbook("airStations.xlsx")
#class(excel)
```

Now let's have a look at all the sheets using **getSheets()**

```{r}
#getSheets(excel)
```

####Reading data with **readWorksheet()** function

```{r}
#readWorksheet(excel, sheet = "airStations")
#This is similar to read_excel
```

We can specify starting and ending row and also starting and ending column.

```{r}
# readWorksheet(excel, sheet = "airStations", startRow=4,
#               endRow = 10, startCol = 3, endCol = 10,
#               header = FALSE)
```

We can create new worksheet and save it in excel working from R.

```{r}
# tech = data.frame(Country = c("Bangladesh", "China", "India", "USA", "Irreland"), 
#                                                 Internet = c(34,56,45,76,71))
# excel = loadWorkbook("airStations.xlsx")
# #Create a new sheet in excel file
# createSheet(excel, name = "Tech")
# #Populate the new worksheet with the value of dataframe tech
# writeWorksheet(excel, tech, sheet = "Tech")
# saveWorkbook(excel, file = "airStations_mod.xlsx")
```

We can also rename sheets using **renameSheet()** function.

```{r}
# renameSheet(excel, "airStations", "stations")
# saveWorkbook(excel, file = "data.xlsx")
```

We can also remove sheet using **removeSheet()**.

```{r}
# removeSheet(excel, sheet = "economy")
# saveWorkbook(excel, file = "data2.xlsx")
```
