ROC Curve -> Receiving Operating Characteristics

 True Positive (TP): Correctly classified as the class of interest
• True Negative (TN): Correctly classified as not the class of interest
• False Positive (FP): Incorrectly classified as the class of interest (Type-1 Error)
• False Negative (FN): Incorrectly classified as not the class of interest (Type-2 Error)

Entropy = Pr(y) * log(Pr(y))
Gini Index = sum(Pr(y) * (1-Pr(y)))
