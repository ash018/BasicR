### Exploratory Data Analysis and Basic statistics

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

We will work with data from different restaurants of Dhaka. The dataset **restaurants** has 4 columns and each row gives the data on restaurant location, service quality, price of buffet and average rating price by customers.

```{r}
restaurants = read.csv("restaurants.csv")
str(restaurants)
```

### Factors

```{r}
levels(restaurants$Service.Quality)
```

#### Service quality vs. rating

```{r}
table(restaurants$Service.Quality, restaurants$Rate)
```

### Selecting without the very bad ones

```{r}
restaurants2 = restaurants %>%
  filter(Rate == "Very  Bad")
```

Let's check the levels of Rate

```{r}
levels(restaurants2$Rate)
```

We see that Very Bad is still there in the levels. To drop this, we need to use **droplevels()**.

```{r}
restaurants2 = restaurants %>%
  filter(Rate == "Very  Bad") %>%
  droplevels()
```

Now, let's make a side-by-side barchart of rate segregated by area.

```{r}
ggplot(restaurants, aes(x = Rate, fill = Area)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

This color range doesn't look good on this barchart. Let's change the color palette.

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
col = brewer.pal(8, "Pastel2")[3:8]
ggplot(restaurants, aes(x = Rate, fill = Area)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Pastel2")
```

### Proportion table

```{r}
quality_vs_rate = table(restaurants$Service.Quality, restaurants$Rate)
prop.table(quality_vs_rate)
```

We see that this gives the proportion with respect to total count.

If we want to know this proportion of rating among different levels of quality of services, we can then do following:

```{r}
prop.table(quality_vs_rate, 1)
```

Now, if we want to know the proportion of quality of services among different levels of rating, we do the following:

```{r}
prop.table(quality_vs_rate, 2)
```

We can also look at this using bar plot in the following way:

```{r}
ggplot(restaurants, aes(x=Service.Quality, fill = Rate)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  ylab("Proportion")
```

Now, let's have a look at whether this pattern remains constant over different areas:

```{r}
fill1 = brewer.pal(9, "PuBuGn")[7]
fill2 = brewer.pal(12, "Set3")[7]
fill3 = brewer.pal(12, "Set3")[c(1,3)]
#fill4 = brewer.pal(12, "Set3")[8]
fill = c(fill1, fill2, fill3)
restaurants$Rate = factor(restaurants$Rate, 
                       levels = c("Very Bad", "Bad", "Good", "Very Good"))
ggplot(restaurants, aes(x=Service.Quality, fill = Rate)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  xlab("Service quality") +
  facet_wrap(~Area) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=fill)
```

### Exploring numerical data

```{r}
str(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl = factor(mtcars$cyl)
```

#### Dotplot

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt)) +
  geom_dotplot()
```

#### Histogram

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

#### Faceted histogram

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~cyl)
```


#### Density plot

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt)) +
  geom_density()
```

### Box plot

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(y=mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

#### Box plot of mpg for different cylinder

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl, y=mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Measure of central tendency

* Mean -- average value -- mean()

```{r}
duration = faithful$eruptions
mean(duration)
```

* Median -- the value which divides the data in 2 parts -- median()

When we are working with skewed distribution, median gives us a better estimate of central tendency than mean.

```{r}
duration = faithful$eruptions
median(duration)
```


* Mode -- the most frequently observed value -- no default function in base R

```{r}
names(table(duration))[table(duration)==max(table(duration))]  
```

Unimodal, bimodal, multimodal etc.

### Measure of dispersion

* Range -- difference between lowest and highest value -- range()

```{r}
range(duration)
```

* Interquartile range -- difference between 3rd and 1st quartile -- IQR()

```{r}
IQR(duration)
```



* Standard deviation -- average distance between each quantity and mean -- sd()

![](C:/Users/ERI/bs_0_0.png)

```{r}
sd(duration)
```

* Variance -- square of average distance between each quantity and mean -- var()

![](C:/Users/ERI/bs_0_1.png)

```{r}
var(duration)
```

* Quartiles -- divides data into quarters -- quantile()

```{r}
duration = faithful$eruptions
quantile(duration)
```


* Skewness -- asymmetry of probability distribution

![](C:/Users/ERI/bs_1.png)

```{r}
library(e1071)
duration = faithful$waiting
skewness(duration)
```

Negative value indicates that it is negatively skewed.

* Kurtosis -- whether our data is heavy-tailed (many outliers) or light-tailed (very few outliers) relative to a normal distribution.

![](C:/Users/ERI/bs_2.png)

```{r}
kurtosis(duration)
```

Negative value indicates that it is platykurtic.

#### Shape of the distribution

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(iris)
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Width, fill = Species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.35)
```
